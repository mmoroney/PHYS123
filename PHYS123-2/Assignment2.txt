Write BASIC programs using the Euler and Feynman algorithms to solve the following problem:

  "A spring of force constant 10 N/m hangs vertically with its upper end
   attached to a fixed support. A 1 kg block attached to the lower end is
   released from rest with the spring initially unstretched at t=0. At what
   time and with what velocity will the block strike a table 1.75 m below
   its point of release?"

Tabulate answers for a time steps of 0.01 and 0.005 sec, and use them to
estimate more accurate vales under the assumption that errors vary as the
square of the time step.

Submit listings of your two programs along with output giving the time and
velocity for each of the two time steps as well as the estimated more accurate
values.
