Use the PLOT program to graph y(t) using the Euler and Feynman algorithms with
a time step of 0.01 sec for the mass-spring system of Assignment No.2:

  "A spring of force constant 10 N/m hangs vertically with its upper end
    attached to a fixed support. A 1 kg block attached to the lower end is
    released from rest with the spring initially unstretched at t=0.""

Plot the two curves on the same graph for a time range from 0 to 6 seconds.
(The table which was present in Assignment No.2 is no longer there.)

as well as PrintScreen and High-Quality Multiwriter graphs.
