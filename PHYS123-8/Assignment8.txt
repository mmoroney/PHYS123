Write a QuickBASIC program which makes use of the routines in the PLOT program
to plot gravitational field lines and equipotentials:

(1) Use the region from x=0 to x=8 and y=0 to y=6 as your plotting area.
    There is a point mass of mass 3M at point x=2, y=3, and a point mass of
    mass M at x=6, y=3. Set z7=1350 in the PLOT program to get a laser printer
    graph with a 3 by 4 aspect ratio which matches your plotting area. Plot
    circles at the point mass locations.

(2) Structure your program into three major subroutines:
     (a) A subroutine which plots a field line from a specified initial point
         until it goes off scale. This subroutine will call the subroutine which
         calculates the field.
     (b) A subroutine which plots an equipotentual from a specified initial
         point until it closes. This subroutine also will call the subroutine
         which calculates the field.
     (c) A subroutine which calculates the field ad x+dx/2, y+dy/2 due to the
         presence of N point masses. The subroutine sums gx and gy over the
         N masses and returns their values along with g=SQR(gx^2+gy^2) to the
         calling program.

(3) Plot 6 field lines originating (plot in the -g direction) from the point
    mass at x=6, y=3, and the equipotential which passes through x=6.9 y=3.
    (You may plot more field lines if you have time, but the pots take a
    fairly long time to complete, so please be considerate if others are
    waiting.)
