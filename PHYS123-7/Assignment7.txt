A simple pendulum consists of a mass M attached to the end of a light rod of
length L the other end of which is attached to a smooth pivot. The period of
oscillation of the pendulum is independent of amplitude at small amplitudes,
but increases with amplitude at larger amplitudes.

Use the numerical integration procedure for integrands of the (1/v) form to
find the percentage by which the period has increased when the amplitude is
(50 + nn) degrees where nn is the last two digits of your ID#. Evaluate the
small amplitude period by using the small angle approximation for the cosine
cos(z) = 1 - (z^2)/2.
