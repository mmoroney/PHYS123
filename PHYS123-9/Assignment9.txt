Use a QuickBASIC program with a Feynman algorithm to solve the dimensionless
form of the bouncing ball Schrodinger equation, and use the routine in
the PLOT program to graph the solution.

(1) Have your program input trial values of the energy from the keyboard and
    plot the solution from x=0 out to four times the distance to the turning
    point. Vary the trial value of the energy to find values for which the
    solution asymptotically approaches the axis. In this manner find the two
    lowest-energy solutions. (The lowest-energy solution does not cross the
    axis before the turning point.) What is the ratio E2/E1?

(2) Plot the lowest-energy solution found in (1) out to four times the
    turning point
    (a) for the energy found in (1),
    (b) for an energy 0.1% higher than the value in (a),
    (c) for an energy 0.1% lower than the value in (a).
