Solve the following problem by numerical integration:

 "How much work is done in overcoming the earth's gravitational attraction when
  an 80 kg astronaut is moved from the earth's surface (r = Re) out to an orbit
  of radius r = 5 Re."

1. Take g = 9.8 m/s^2, Re = 6.37 x 10^6 m, and write an expression for the work
   done in the form of a dimensionless integral multiplied by a constant with
   the dimensions of work.

2. Evaluate the dimensionless integral using the trapezoid rule. Compare the
   answer you obtain using 80 intervals with the result obtained by analytic
   evaluation of the integral.

3. By what factor is the 80-interval error reduced when (A(80)-A(40))/3 is used
   as a correction?
